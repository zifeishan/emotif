				<p>"Cause you had a bad day<br>
					You're taking one down<br>
					You sing a sad song just to turn it around<br>
					You say you don't know<br>
					You tell me don't lie <br>
					You work at a smile and you go for a ride<br>
					You had a bad day<br>
					The camera don't lie<br>
					You're coming back down and you really don't mind<br>
					You had a bad day<br>
					You had a bad day"<br>
